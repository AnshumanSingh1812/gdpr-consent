### To read the AndroidManifest.xml file using apktool, you can follow these steps:

### Install apktool: Download and install apktool from the official website. You can find the download link and installation instructions at: https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/

### Open a command prompt or terminal. Navigate to the directory where the APK file is located. For example:

$ cd C:\Users\ansh1\Downloads\strava-308-9

### Run the following command to decompile the APK:

$ apktool d -o output-folder app.apk

### Replace app.apk with the name of the APK file you want to decompile. This command will create a new folder named output-folder (you can choose any desired name) and decompile the APK into it. Navigate to the output folder:

$ cd output-folder

### Locate and open the AndroidManifest.xml file in a text editor of your choice. You should find it in the output-folder directory.

$ notepad AndroidManifest.xml

### This command will open the file in Notepad. Alternatively, you can use any text editor you prefer, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
